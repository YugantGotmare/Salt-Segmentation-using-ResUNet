# ResUNet: Semantic Segmentation with Residual U-Net

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

ResUNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It extends the U-Net architecture by incorporating residual connections for improved training and performance. This repository provides the implementation of ResUNet along with a Streamlit web app for interactive image segmentation.

## Key Features

- U-Net architecture with encoder and decoder paths.
- Residual connections for improved optimization.
- Batch normalization and activation functions.
- Dropout for preventing overfitting.
- Dice coefficient loss for segmentation tasks.

## Web App

The included Streamlit web app allows users to upload images for segmentation using the trained ResUNet model. It provides an interactive way to visualize the segmentation results
